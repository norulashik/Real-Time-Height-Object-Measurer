##  Calibration System

This code is **calibrated to a fixed frame setup**. It calculates **pixels per cm** by asking the user to click on two points on a known object (e.g., A4 paper = 210mm width).

- Calibration is crucial for accurate real-world measurements.
- The calibration values **vary for different cameras and positions**, so always calibrate once before using.
- Use the **Calibrate** button to input your known objectâ€™s height and mark its top and bottom on the frame.
- The measured values like human height, weight, and object volume are based entirely on this pixel/cm ratio.
