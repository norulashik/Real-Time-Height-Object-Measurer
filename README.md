# Real-Time-Height-Object-Measurer
A real-time height, weight, and object dimension estimator. This application captures a live video feed from the webcam (or DroidCam), detects the human silhouette and pose landmarks to estimate height and weight, and also detects surrounding objects with bounding boxes, calculating their height, width, and approximate volume.
